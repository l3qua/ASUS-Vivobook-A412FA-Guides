**Note:** If you have any problem that is not mentioned here, you can ask for help at [r/Hackintosh Paradise Discord server](https://discord.gg/u8V7N5C). **PLEASE MAKE YOUR OWN EFI AND FOLLOW THE RULES WHEN ASKING FOR HELP**

**Small tip when following guides:** To have a lower chance of corrupting your config.plist, avoid using configurators (e.g. OCAT, OpenCore Configurator,...) and use plist editors. [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) is recommended since it is just an ordinary plist editor with additional features for OpenCore users (e.g. Force FileVault on Broken seals, IOSkywalk block for wifi root-patching,... ). Using a configurator also prevents you from getting support at [r/Hackintosh Paradise Discord server](https://discord.gg/u8V7N5C)
